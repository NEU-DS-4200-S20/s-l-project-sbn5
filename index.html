    <h1>Project Team ##SBN5: Distribution of Products/Services of Members: Topic, DS 4200 S20</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Megha Rao</strong>, <strong>Coleen Ross</strong>, <strong>Omkar Brahme</strong>, <strong>Snowy Chen</strong></p>
    
    <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1781714">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dcashm01/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>SBN's core missions is to build a community that can support a culture of sustainability and local food. There are many organizations that care about local food, but it can be difficult for them to know that they have many other similar-minded organizations nearby.
    </em></p>

    <p>
      <em>SBN has a member directory containing information about all buyers, vendors, and other organizations.  They wanted to build a visualization that will go into marketing materials and on their website to communicate the scope of their work and to connect members of the local food community.</em>
    </p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: SBN's existing database was not a pretty sight, and they did not find it visually appealing enough to display on their website. They wanted a visualization that would target business who were interested in joining the network and seeing who else is involved. What they were specifically looking for was a list + visualization to represent all the existing businesses in the network. </em></p>

    
    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    
    <p><em>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</em></p>
    
  </div>
  
  <!-- Your visualization here -->
  <div class="vis-holder">
    <!-- Change viewbox to whatever you want, e.g. "0 0 1000 6000" This determines your aspect ratio and coordinate system -->    
    <!-- Delete all the sample SVG code below after the viewbox to before the closing tag. Populate this part of the SVG with D3. -->
    <svg id="vis-svg"
      preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" class="marks" viewBox="0 0 821 520" 
    <!-- Don't delete the closing tag! -->
    </svg>

    <h1>Demo Video</h1>
    
    <p><em>TODO: Attach our video here</em></p>
    
    <video controls width="100%">
      <source src="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
       a <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
    </video>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>In conclusion, our visualization represents the existing businesses registered with SBN through a map + table through brushing and linking. In the future, instead of a table, linking it to a bar graph could be more visually appealing.

    </em></p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
